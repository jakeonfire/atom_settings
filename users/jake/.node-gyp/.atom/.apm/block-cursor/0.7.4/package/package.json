This package allows the cursor to be customized in a number of ways.\n\n## config\n\n#### cursor type\n\nThe cursor can be one of the following:\n* Block <br>![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-block.png)\n* Bordered-box <br>![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-bordered-box.png)\n* I-beam <br>![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-i-beam.png)\n* Underline <br>![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-underline.png)\n\n#### primary cursor color & secondary cursor color\n\nThe primary and secondary colors determine the color of the cursor in it's `blink-on` and `blink-off` state, respectively. From the settings menu, you can't set transparency, so if you want transparency, that has to be done by editing the `~/.atom/config.cson` file directly. Consult [the docs](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/Config#color) about color objects.\n\n#### pulse duration\n\nSet the pulse duration to let the cursor fade from `primary color` to `secondary color`, instead of the default blinking behavior.\n\n![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-pulse.gif)\n\n## notes\n\n#### cursor not visible if syntax theme uses current-line highlighting\n\nThe `block` cursor has a `z-index` of `-1`, so that it will render behind text. Some syntax themes, however, set a `background-color` on the line the cursor is in. This causes the cursor to be invisible. A workaround is to set the following in your `styles.less`:\n\n```\natom-text-editor::shadow .cursors .cursor {\n  z-index: 1!important;\n}\n```\n\nAnd add some transparency to the `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor` settings.\n\n## copyright\n\nCopyright 2015 Olmo Kramer under MIT license.","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor","_id":"block-cursor@0.7.4","_shasum":"83453c78ab0518a1e25f2c36cbef251a88e6356e","_resolved":"file:../d-115029-60444-rzi0b2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115029-60444-rzi0b2/package.tgz"}
